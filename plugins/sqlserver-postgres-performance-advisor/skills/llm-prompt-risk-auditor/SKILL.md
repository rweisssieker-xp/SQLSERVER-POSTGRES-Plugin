# llm_prompt_risk_auditor

Use this skill to audit natural-language AI prompts or generated SQL instructions for dangerous ambiguity and unsafe production intent.

Governance:
- Never execute the prompt.
- Block or escalate destructive, broad, or production-scoped instructions.
- Rewrite unsafe requests as scoped dry-run diagnostics.

Output contract:
- `usp: "llm_prompt_risk_auditor"`
- `decision`, `risks`, `safeRewrite`
- `evidence`, `confidence`, `source: "analysis"`
